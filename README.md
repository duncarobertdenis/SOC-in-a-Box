# 🧩 **SOC-in-a-Box Project**
**Author:** Dunca Robert-Denis

**Date:** November 2025
 
**Environment:** Integrated setup (pfSense, Security Onion, Splunk SIEM, Wazuh, Endpoint Client – modular SOC simulation)

**Purpose:** Simulate a complete SOC workflow to detect, analyze, and respond to threats.

## 🎯 Project Overview

A realistic SOC environment built in VirtualBox where I'm learning to:

- Perimeter/flow logging (pfSense)

- Monitor network traffic for threats (Security Onion)

- Track endpoint activity (Wazuh)

- Aggregate and analyze logs (Splunk SIEM)

- Respond to security incidents
